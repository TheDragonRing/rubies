# Rubies

Rubies is a resource pack that replaces diamonds with rubies. Completely. Everything from diamond tools to diamond horse armour to diamond ore has been replaced with its ruby counterpart.

To use it, simply download and open the [`rubies.mcpack`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheDragonRing/rubies/master/rubies.mcpack) file. If you wish for items/blocks to use the name "ruby" rather than "diamond", go into your language settings after loading the pack and select "English (RUBIES)".

_For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition (Windows 10, iOS, Android + more...)_
